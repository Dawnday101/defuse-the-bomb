# defuse-the-bomb
Disarming the bomb requires you to cut some wires.  The wires are either white, black, purple, red, green, or orange. The rules are as follows:
If you cut a white cable you can't cut a white or black cable next.
If you cut a red cable you have to cut a green one.
If you cut a black cable it is not allowed to cut a white, green or orange one.
If you cut an orange one, you should cut a red or black one.
If you cut a green one you have to cut an orange or white one.
If you cut a purple you can't cut a purple, green, orange or white cable.
If anything is cut in the wrong order it explodes.

You will recieve a sequence of wires that were cut in that order and you have to determine if the person was successful
at disarming the bomb or is it blew up.
